Hi, I'm Matej,

An engineer with a passion for building software. I’ve spent the last few years diving deep into DevOps and cloud
development, always staying excited about open source and driving projects forward as developer.
I’m constantly amazed by the world of AI, though I wish I had more time to keep up with it.

This page is a place for my ideas and tech posts, either things I’ve published before or notes I want to keep organized.
Some notes might be a bit rough, as I’ve quickly turned them into tech posts. Thanks for understanding!

Check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matej-feder-9bba27111) if you’re interested in the projects I’ve worked on.
